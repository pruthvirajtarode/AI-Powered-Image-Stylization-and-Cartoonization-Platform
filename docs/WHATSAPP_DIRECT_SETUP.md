## 3-Minute Setup

### 1. Get WhatsApp Business Credentials

Go to [Meta Developers Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/):

1. Create/login to Meta Business Account
2. Go to **Apps > Your App > WhatsApp**
3. In **API Setup**, you'll find:
   - **Phone Number ID** - Copy this
   - **Business Account ID** - Copy this
   - **Generate Token** - Create new access token

### 2. Set Environment Variables on Render

Dashboard → Your App → **Environment**

Add these 4 variables:

```
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID = 123456789012345
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID = 987654321098765
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN = EAAxxxxxx...
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN = toonify_webhook_token
```

Click **Deploy**

### 3. Configure Webhook

Back in Meta Dashboard, WhatsApp > **Webhook Settings**:

1. Click **Setup Webhook**
2. **Callback URL:** 
   ```
   https://toonify-ai-saas.onrender.com/api/whatsapp/webhook
   ```
3. **Verify Token:** 
   ```
   toonify_webhook_token
   ```
4. **Subscribe to events:** Check ✅ `messages`
5. Click **Verify and Save**

✅ **Done!** Users can now message your WhatsApp number with photos.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "403 Forbidden" on verify | Check WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN matches |
| No messages received | Verify webhook fields include "messages" |
| Images not downloading | Check WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN is valid |
| No response sent back | Check disk space in `data/processed_images/` |
